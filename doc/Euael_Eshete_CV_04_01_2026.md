Security Architecture: Designed and implemented the RBAC Role-Based Access Control) module for the client-facing 
security dashboard using 
ASP.NET Core, ensuring strict data isolation between tenants.
Containerization Strategy: Standardised the deployment pipeline by containerising legacy .NET services with Docker, 
reducing environment parity issues between dev and production.
Frontend Performance: Optimised Razor Pages rendering logic to reduce Time-to-Interactive TTI for high-density 
data grids.
Software Developer
AfroChat A2SV  Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
September 2023  March 2025
High-Concurrency Architecture: Architected a non-blocking, asynchronous backend using FastAPI Python) and 
LiteStar, scaling from 1,250 to 58,000 monthly messages while supporting 2,000 active users.
Cost-Efficient Migration: Engineered a zero-downtime storage migration plan moving media assets to GCP Cloud 
Storage, rewriting asset delivery to reduce infrastructure overhead by 94%.
LLM Pipeline Engineering: Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation RAG pipeline, integrating vector databases and 
OpenAI APIs; optimised prompt caching strategies to reduce API latency and token costs, increasing user retention by 
30%.
Infrastructure Scaling: Orchestrated the transition from monolithic deployment to containerised services on GCP 
Cloud Run, implementing auto-scaling policies based on CPU and request latency metrics.
Market-Specific Engineering: Developed a lightweight Telegram Mini-App wrapper, solving unique authentication and 
session management challenges within the Telegram webview environment, onboarding 300 users.
